# Lambda Musika - The functional DAW

A JavaScript DAW that emphasizes functions as its core building block. In practice,
a realtime audio scripting language and batteries-included DSP library, running
on the web.

Keep in mind JavaScript is not the best language for CPU-intensive tasks, so
performance will be limited.

On the other hand, it runs in your browser.

## Usage

A Musika script is just regular JS program:

- interpreted client side
- that returns a function `t => [l, r]`
- where `t` is time
- and `l` and `r` are output samples for the left and right channels in `[-1, 1]`
  range

For now there is no static documentation available, just dive in the source code
and learn form the [default song](src/components/App/default-song.js) and [other
examples](#examples).

##### - Available defines:

- `sampleRate`, current audio device sample rate.
- `setLength(secs)`, sets the total length of the song in seconds.
  - Used to seek using the time slider.
  - When omitted the time slider is disabled and the sound is played endlessly
    (useful for drone or procedural music).
- `Musika`, the [Musika library](lib/):
  - [Generator](lib/Generator.js) units
  - [Envelope](lib/Generator.js) functions
  - [Filter](lib/Filter/index.js) units
  - [Operator](lib/Operator.js) functions
  - [Music](lib/Music.js) helpers that aid with traditional composition.
  - [Util](lib/Util.js)

##### - Script skeleton:

```js
const {Generator, Envelope, Filter, Operator, Music, Util} = Musika

return t => [0, 0]
```

## Examples

##### - Binaural beat

```js
const {Generator} = Musika

const F = 79            // Base frequency
const DF = 4            // Beat frequency
const A = Math.SQRT1_2  // Amplitude

const oscL = Generator.Sin(), oscR = Generator.Sin()

return t => [oscL(F, t) * A, oscR(F + DF, t) * A]
```

##### - Filtered noise

```js
const {Filter} = Musika

const NoiseGen = () => {
  const A = Math.SQRT1_2  // Amplitude = 0.707
  const COEFF = Filter.Biquad.LP(400/sampleRate, Math.SQRT1_2)  // Cutoff = 400Hz, Q = 0.707

  const filter = Filter.Biquad()
  return () => filter(COEFF, Math.random() * A)
}

const noiseL = NoiseGen(), noiseR = NoiseGen()

return () => [noiseL(), noiseR()]
```

##### - Simple sea

```js
const {Generator, Filter} = Musika

const NoiseGen = () => {
  const A = Math.SQRT1_2  // Amplitude = 0.707

  const filter = Filter.Biquad()
  return cutoff => {
    let coeff = Filter.Biquad.LP(cutoff/sampleRate, Math.SQRT1_2)
    return filter(coeff, Math.random() * A)
  }
}

const noiseL = NoiseGen(), noiseR = NoiseGen()
const cutL = Generator.Sin(), cutR = Generator.Sin()

return t => [
  noiseL(300 + cutL(0.1, t) * 200),
  noiseR(300 + cutR(0.08, t) * 200),
]
```

## Development

- [Open tasks](TODO.md)
- Start a development server at `localhost:8888`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

- Build the application in the `build/` directory:

```sh
npm run build
```
