# Lambda Musika â€” The functional DAW

https://lambda.cuesta.dev/

A JavaScript DAW that emphasizes functions as its core building block. In practice,
a realtime audio scripting language and batteries-included DSP library, running
on the web.

Keep in mind JavaScript is not the best language for CPU-intensive tasks, so
performance will be limited.

On the other hand, it runs in your browser.

## Usage

A Musika script is just a regular JS script:

- interpreted client side
- that returns a function `t => [l, r]`
- where `t` is time
- and `l` and `r` are output samples for the left and right channels in `[-1, 1]`
  range

For now there is no static documentation available, just dive in the source code
and learn form the [default song](examples/default.js) and other [examples](examples/).

##### - Available defines:

- `sampleRate`, current audio device sample rate.
- `setLength(secs)`, sets the total length of the song in seconds.
  - Used to seek using the time slider.
  - When omitted the time slider is disabled and the sound is played endlessly
    (useful for drone or procedural music).
- `Musika`, the [Musika library](lib/Musika/):
  - [Generator](lib/Musika/Generator.js) units
  - [Envelope](lib/Musika/Generator.js) functions
  - [Filter](lib/Musika/Filter/index.js) units
  - [Operator](lib/Musika/Operator.js) functions
  - [Music](lib/Musika/Music.js) helpers that aid with traditional composition.
  - [Util](lib/Musika/Util.js)

##### - Script skeleton:

```js
const { Generator, Envelope, Filter, Operator, Music, Util } = Musika;

return (t) => [0, 0];
```

## Development

- Start a development server at `localhost:8888`:

```sh
npm run dev
```

- Build the application in the `build/` directory:

```sh
npm run build
```

- See [open tasks](TODO.md)
